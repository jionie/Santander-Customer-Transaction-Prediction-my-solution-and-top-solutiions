These are the code that I used to understand data and the power of my FE.<br/>
1.**VeryveryDeepEDA contains all the EDA that I done, some of the codes maybe messy, but the functions are very useful and you can just copy paste to use them.**<br/>
2.**Final-EDA is the code that I use to check distribuiton of target 0 and target 1 of each variable, I used it to check the power of my FE.**
